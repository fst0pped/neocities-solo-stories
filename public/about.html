      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Andrew. I'm a nerd who got into tabletop roleplaying via tabletop wargaming and D&D podcasts.</p>

      <p>If you would like to interact with a near-real-time version of me you can find me on Mastodon <a href="https://tabletop.social/@fst0pped">@fst0pped@tabletop.social</a>.</p>

      <h2>Tools and tricks</h2>

      <p>For shorter journalling games or games where paper and pen help the vibe, I write first on paper and then type up onto the website. However, for longer form play (like Ironsworn) I'll use a notetaking app on my PC and convert to HTML with a Markdown > HTML converter. Links to some of my favourites below:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a></strong> - A hugely flexible markdown-based note taking app. Designed to be used anywhere, I have this set up to sync across devices via GitHub but you can pay for a subscription to the Obsidian vault if you don't want the technical hassle. Other note taking apps are available, but this one is mine.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://ironvault.quest/">Iron Vault</a></strong> - A plugin for Obsidian that turns it into a virtual tabletop for playing Ironsworn. Includes the moves and oracles, and has features for managing progress tracks and world truths. Even has a built-in dice roller that will automatically pick up your stats and prompt you through the process of building a dice roll. An amazing tool which is still actively under development.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://ironvault.quest/">Iron Journal</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://pocketforge.rockpaperstory.com/">PocketForge</a></strong> - Progressive webapps for playing the Ironsworn family of games. Loads of useful features to help you with moves and oracles, to build and track your character's development, the NPCs you encounter and even to make and update maps of your world to chart your travels. I found these incredibly useful in the beginning, and the only reason I'm not using them now is that I like the security of GitHub for backup and sync of my ongoing campaigns.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Obviously mucking around with HTML and CSS is also one of my hobbies and I've thoroughly enjoyed building a website like it's 2003. There are a couple of tools that have made working with a static Neocities site much easier, significantly reducing the friction to sharing here and increasing the odds that I keep coming back and posting updates.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a></strong> - A tiny Javascript implementation built with neocities in mind that handles some of the basic blogging features like the next/previous post links and the lists of blogposts. Lightweight and very hackable even with my extremely modest Javascript knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a></strong> - A pre-written GitHub action with step by step tutorial, which auto-pushes code to Neocities when you update your GitHub main branch. Has saved me hundreds of clicks already.</li>
      </ul>
