      <h1>What is 'solo RP'?</h1>
      <p>A normal first reaction to hearing about <em>Solo Role Play</em> is "How does that work? How can I be surprised if I'm deciding what happens next?" You might wonder how on earth you get started, or whether you need to be an aspiring writer to get anything out of the hobby.</p>

      <p>There are Youtube channels and Discord servers and all sorts of places you can go for advice, but when I got started I found that the single most useful resource was other people's actual play blogs. Seeing the story threads interspersed with the mechanics and little insights into the writers' thought process; seeing all these different players with their own take on solo gaming, it helped me realise that there's no right or wrong way to play and that getting started is as simple as sitting down with a book and throwing your character into a tricky situation.</p>

      <p>And when I played my first game I quickly found that, despite many years of trying and failing, I can actually write an interesting story! All I need is a prompt or a dice roll to shunt my brain off its well-worn narrative rails and inject some randomness into the process. Soon I was surprising myself and enjoying the solo ride just as much as I enjoy the shared play experience. I think anyone can have this moment of revelation.</p>

      <h3>What can I find here?</h3>

      <p>The purpose of this blog/site is to give a little back to that community of online solo RPers and hopefully do my bit to help those who follow to find their way into the hobby. Posts will be playthroughs and reviews of whatever solo TTRPG is currently on my table. Happy soloing!</p>
