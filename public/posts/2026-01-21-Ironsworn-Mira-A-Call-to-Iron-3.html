      <p class="meta">We catch up with Mira who has just dispatched a Bladewing and is now beginning an exploration of the ruins it was guarding.</p>
      <p class="meta">Time to continue the Delve and hope against hope that we don't roll up another denizen. I really don't want to get into another fight here.</p>

    <p class="mechanics">
		<strong>Delve the Depths:</strong> Wits<br />
		<strong>Roll:</strong> 5 + 3 (Wits) vs 1 and 7 = Strong Hit<br />
		Mark progress and find an opportunity<br />
		<strong>Progress:</strong> 6/10<br />
		You locate a secure area<br />
		Take action now: make a move, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
	</p>

	<p>Mira makes her way toward the back of the ruined structure to where the building is more or less intact, reasoning that this will be where the foundations are deeper and more robust. It pays off when she sees a wooden hatch set into the floor, heavy but unlocked. Picking out a likely looking timber she hauls it over and uses her staff as leverage, lifting the heavy wooden hatch cover and using the timber to wedge it open.</p>

	<p class="mechanics">
		<strong>Face Danger:</strong> Wits<br />
		<strong>Roll:</strong> 5 + 3 (Wits) + 1 (Opportunity) vs 2 and 10 = Weak Hit<br />
		Succeed but are delayed, +-1 momentum (Opportunity bonus and Face Danger cost) (+4)
	</p>

	<p>It's difficult work, Mira is clever and quick but she's not especially strong, and it takes time to lever the hatch open bit by bit. But gradually she gets it vertical enough to throw her bodyweight against the old, weathered wood and push it all the way open. This seems a likely place for a hunter to hide from wolves, and in the darkness it would be an easy place to lose a knife.</p>
	
	<p>Lighting a torch, Mira proceeds carefully down into the basement room keeping her eyes wide open for danger.</p>
	
	<p class="mechanics">
		<strong>Delve the Depths:</strong> Wits<br />
		<strong>Roll:</strong>  6 + 3 (Wits) vs 4 and 3 = Strong Hit<br />
		Mark progress and find an opportunity<br />
		<strong>Progress:</strong> 9/10<br />
		This area provides an opportunity to scavenge, forage or hunt<br />

	<p class="meta">A perfect opportunity to try and resupply out in the middle of nowhere. If we're saying this looks like an old storage barn then it seems very reasonable that there might be some useful stuff preserved in a cellar.</p>
	
	<p class="mechanics">
		<strong>Resupply:</strong>
		<strong>Roll:</strong>  3 + 3 (Wits) + 1 (Opportunity) vs 3 and 3 = Strong Hit with a match<br />
		Take 2 supply (+5 max), +1 momentum (Opportunity) (+5)<br />
		<em>I think between the resupply and the matched 3s I'm going to say that I find a new blanket that will replace my tattered bedroll alongside a dusty bag of grains that look old but dry, and which are probably very edible if cooked into a porridge. I don't fancy roleplaying a night in the open in the ironlands with no blanket. And the old one can be bandages, which will likely also be useful.</em><br />
	</p>
	
	<p>Down a short staircase is a small square room with stone walls and flagstone floor. Old, dusty equipment is piled up against the back wall, and in amongst the barrels are a stack of thick woollen blankets woven in the style of the old world, with intricate embroidery around the edges. Mira gratefully takes one, but leaves the rest for future travellers. She also scoops up enough dried grains from an old sack to fill a large pouch. Boiled up with river water these should keep her going for a couple of meals at least.</p>

	<p class="mechanics">
		<strong>Locate your objective</strong><br />
		<strong>Roll:</strong> Progress 9 vs 1 and 3 = Strong Hit<br />
		You locate your objective and the situation favours you. Take +1 momentum (+6)
	</p>

	<p>In the corner of the room Mira catches a glint of metal and smiles as she identifies the knife she was searching for. The ironlands are a hard master, but they reward persistence. She tucks it into her belt and makes her way back up the staircase, her spirit battered but slightly renewed.</p>
