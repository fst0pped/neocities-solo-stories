      <h2>Act 1 - The High Era</h2>

      <p class="meta">The first act of the game shows the ship at its peak. This is a time of glory, becore hard use and the ravages of time have had a chance to inflict scars, physical and/or metaphorical.</p>

      <h3>Captain 1 - A bold, optimistic explorer</h3>

      <h4>Captain creation</h4>

      <p class="meta">We start by generating our first captain. The game provides a number of pre-sets themed for each era, but I'm going off script to get something more closely tied to my ship creation.</p>

      <p><strong>Describe the Captain and consider how they took command of your ship, and any notable crew or assets.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: James Deckard</li>
        <li>Appointed captain by the organisation that constructed the ship.</li>
        <li>Military veteran with spotless record, known for fair and principled leadership.</li>
        <li>Crew of scientists and explorers, not great fighters but expert survivalists.</li>
        <li>Exo-vehicle mech-suit intended for moving cargo on board and planetside exploration.</li>
        <li>No offensive weapons fixed to the ship, just EMP cannons to ward off aggressive intent. Believed not carrying weapons would make it easier to cross borders.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="meta">The pre-sets come with their own question/prompts depending on captain type, but the format is simple enough that I had no trouble imagining a couple of my own for this bold explorer with a storied military background. The game encourages you to see the prompts as guidelines and to go off-piste if it makes sense for the story you want to tell.</p>

      <p><strong>How did your captain get their reputation?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>James Deckard was best known for averting a shooting war with a neighbouring civilisation by standing his ground and talking them down.</li>
        <li>Made reasonable promises and kept them. Was respected by both sides.</li>
        <li>Turned away from a career in diplomacy because he loved the stars.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How did they lead by example and gain the respect of their crew?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Picked a first mate from the scientific institute rather than a fellow military mind.</li>
        <li>Regularly clashed with them but James wanted to make sure that the core scientific mission was represented in the command structure of the mission.</li>
        <li>The two were never friends but kept each other honest and pushed each other to achieve great things.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Memorable events</h4>

      <p class="meta">Since this is the High Era and our mission is the betterment of mankind we'll take our memorable event from the <strong>Love and Triumph</strong> table. And no more off-script work needed, it already has the perfect prompt.

      <p><strong>You struck out into the unknown, discovering a brand new stellar phenomena together exploring distanct stars.</strong></p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Discovered humanity's first wormhole and gathered information that revolutionised humanity's understanding of the universe.</li>
        <li>The Captain and First Mate decided to call the phenomena the <em>Decker-Maillard</em> wormhole in recognition of the fact that neither could have completed this assignment without the other</li>
      </ul>
