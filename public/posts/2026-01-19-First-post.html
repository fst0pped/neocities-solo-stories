      <p>The traditional first (and often only...) blogpost to get things moving and check that the formatting all works as expected.</p>

      <p>I discovered Solo TTRPGs by accident and quickly got hooked. I've always considered myself a very mediocre creative writer, and it turns out a lot of my problems can be solved with a bit of prompting or an injection of randomness - something solo games are very good at doing.</p>

      <p>I made great use of actual-play posts online when I was learning what this solo gaming malarkey is all about, so setting up my own blog is my way of giving back to a community that has been so good for my own self-image. You, too, can be creative! You might just need a little help to get started.</p>
